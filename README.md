Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User sees app icon in home screen and styled launch screen
- [x] User can sign in using OAuth login flow
- [x] User can Logout
- [x] User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline
- [x] In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, and timestamp.
- [x] User can pull to refresh.
- [x] User can tap the retweet and favorite buttons in a tweet cell to retweet and/or favorite a tweet.
- [x] User can compose a new tweet by tapping on a compose button.

- [x] User should display the relative timestamp for each tweet "8m", "7h"
- [x] Tweet Details Page: User can tap on a tweet to view it, with controls to retweet and favorite.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] User can view their profile in a *profile tab*
  - Contains the user header view: picture and tagline
  - Contains a section with the users basic stats: # tweets, # following, # followers
  - [ ] Profile view should include that user's timeline

- [ ] Links in tweets are clickable.
- [ ] User can tap the profile image in any tweet to see another user's profile
  - Contains the user header view: picture and tagline
  - Contains a section with the users basic stats: # tweets, # following, # followers
- [ ] User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the feed using infinite loading similar to the actual Twitter client.
- [x] When composing, you should have a countdown for the number of characters remaining for the tweet (out of 280) (**1 point**)
- [ ] After creating a new tweet, a user should be able to view it in the timeline immediately without refetching the timeline from the network.
- [ ] User can reply to any tweet, and replies should be prefixed with the username and the reply_id should be set when posting the tweet (**2 points**)
- [ ] User sees embedded images in tweet if available
- [ ] User can switch between timeline, mentions, or profile view through a tab bar (**3 points**)
- [ ] Profile Page: pulling down the profile page should blur and resize the header image. (**4 points**)


The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Reuse code between MovieCell and the DetailsTweetViewController, since they shared many labels and properties. DetailsTweetViewController did not contain a TableView and required repetitive code.
2. Add the ability to follow another user in the app.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Had issues with GitHub uploading Keys.plist, which was resolved by eventually deleting it from all previous commits. 
- Had issue with data not appearing in the TableView, which was caused by not setting self.tableView.delegate and self.tableView.dataSource, as well as erroneously calling initWithDictionary when it was already called previously.
- Favorite and retweet button did not update immediately after the app started, which required moving the update code into TimelineViewController.m.
- Tab bar did not show up until logout and logging back into the app. Needed to switch the load-in view upon successful sign in in AppDelegate.m.
